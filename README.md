# Automation Scripts
#### This repo contains scripts for setting up a new installation of Ubuntu with common applications and configurations. Tested most thoroughly on Ubuntu 18.04 - 20.04 with the expectation that things will break and be repaired over time.   

### ubuntu_setup.sh
#### Run after a fresh install of Ubuntu to quickly set up commonly used applications and tools. 

### after_reboot.sh
#### Run after ubuntu_setup.sh and a system reboot has been completed. Mostly only useful if installing the Nvidia overclocking utility.


### update_kernel.sh
#### Update the kernel to the manually entered version at the top or comment/uncomment where the #AUTO and #MANUAL tags are found to install the latest version.


### util
#### Scripts automating frequent tasks 


### install
#### Scripts automating the installation of applications and tools not included in the main ubuntu_setup.sh script.
